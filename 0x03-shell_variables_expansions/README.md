| **0-alias** | A script that creates a dangerous alias. It changes the function of the standard command **`ls`** to become an alias for the command **`rm *`** (deleting all files in the current directory). The goal is to demonstrate the priority of aliases over system commands and how to bypass them using `\ls`. |
